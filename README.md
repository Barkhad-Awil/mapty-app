## Mapty - Your Ultimate Workout Tracking Tool

Discover the ultimate workout tracking tool with Mapty - a unique application that utilizes a vast map to log your exercise routes.

## Getting Started

When you first load the application, your browser will ask for permission to access your location. Once granted, JavaScript will automatically fetch and load the map at your current position.

## Logging Your Workouts

Mapty's primary goal is to simplify workout logging. Here's how to get started:

1. Click on the location on the map where you had a workout.
2. A special form with several fields will appear on the left side.
3. Choose from options like running or cycling.
4. Fill in the distance and time.
5. Press enter to save your workout.
   The form will be replaced with a workout list, and you can even click on past workouts to move the map to that location.

## Credits
